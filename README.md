# Cisco Communications Manager (CUCM) JTAPI example

The Handler.java file contains an example of a Java program that monitors a CUCM device, provides call state information, and calculates call duration.

It is based on [this repo](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/jtapi-samples), follow the same _Getting Started steps_, and replace the Handler.java file at 'src/main/java/com/cisco/jtapi/superProvider_deviceStateServer'.
